# Gathering Restaurant Reviews from Google APIs


## API Wrapper - googlemaps
[This](https://github.com/googlemaps/google-maps-services-python?tab=readme-ov-file) library wraps several APIs.  I was unable to run Client().geo until I completely unrestricted the API key.  I had previously enabled 7 APIs that I thought were all I needed related to Maps, Places, Geocoding, etc. but apparently it needed something else as well.
